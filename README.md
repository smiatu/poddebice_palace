# poddebice_palace
(Work in progress)
This project is intended to be a 3D model of a palace placed in PoddÄ™bice, Poland. 
It's an exercise aimed for self-development in both graphic design/front-end development and architecture.

To run it you should download 'project' folder and simply run 'palace_model.html' in your browser. 
Enjoy :)
